# *Class name*

This is the same name that will be used in the course catalog, syllabus, lesson plans, etc.

# Class Plan

The *Class Plan* is a high-level description of the class, intended to guide the instructional design process. It is created by course authors and reviewed by their peers and the school Advisory Board. It is not intended for a student audience.

# Overview

The *Overview* is a single, short paragraph that summarizes the rest of this document.

# Rationale

The *rationale* is the elevator pitch of the class plan. In a short, list or table format, it needs to answer several central questions:

   * What are the reasons for having the course?
   * What population or populations does it serve?
   * Who is sponsoring the course? How is it funded?
   * What is unique about it?
   * Why should anyone participate as a learner or sponsor?

# Target Population

The target population statement must include those aspects of the population that can cause critical instructional design decisions. Target populations are lengthy and include specific data and analysis. At PCS, the target population is checked against the school mission, marketing, and employer network to verify that there is a viable market for the class prior to development.

## Participant Prerequisites

It is an absolute necessity that participants meet any prerequisites for a course they are slated to attend. This gatekeeper process describes entry-level competencies that are necessary to prevent population mismatches in courses. Specify how potential students will be evaluated to make sure they meet prerequisite standards. Apply ranging to set the highest and lowest points of entry for participation in the course.

# Profitability analysis

The instructor is not directly responsible to author this section, but this information should either be obtained from staff or authored by staff. In most cases, instructors will want to know that this information is known and of a high quality. Nobody wants to waste their time developing a course that will lose money or never be sold at all.

The *target market* portion of this section must include an analysis of what initial market segment will be targeted, what their compelling reason to buy is (career change, for example), and some estimate of how large this market is. Provide evidence. This can include anything that you know “we had a meeting with Nike and they might be interested” or “we have 30 people who have already put a deposit on the course.”  For this document, the quality of the market analysis is not as important as accurately recording what in fact has been done.

The *class cost* portion of this section must include administrative overhead, rental for the facilities, equipment, class materials and subscriptions, instructor cost, etc. Break into base costs (the cost to get the facilities, computers, , instructor, materials, tools, etc., and teach the first student) and incremental, per-student costs (including incremental teaching assistants if provided for larger classes). Staff can provide sample costs.



# Description

This description section of the design plan paints a picture of the structure of the training. Common elements to consider for the course description are:

   * total course length
   * module length (if appropriate)
   * instructional methods
   * materials

# Goals & Objectives

Goals are general statements of desired outcomes, whereas objectives are detailed statements of outcomes.

Goals match well-written job listings.

Learning objectives have two aspects: *terminal* and *enabling* -- Students accomplish enabling objectives during the class on their way to accomplishing terminal objectives at the end of the class.

## Terminal learning objectives.

Terminal learning objectives (TLOs) define terminal or exit competencies expected of a learner at the end of a course, module, or program. These are the main "interface spec" for the class. Students who accomplish the terminal objectives in a preparatory class are ready for a career track class. Students who accomplish the terminal objectives in a career track class are ready for employment.

The most common protocol for writing terminal and enabling objectives is what is termed the A-B-C-D format. 

* A represents *audience*. 
* B represents *behavior* or task. (behavior statements are worded in the format “should be able to _____________”) Behavior needs to be observable and measurable. Verbs such as “create,” “write,” “list,” “construct,” and “repair” are observable, measurable, and suitable for statements of behavior in written objectives. Make sure that the behavior matches both the objective domain and the expected mastery.
* C represents *conditions*. Condition statements begin with the word “given” followed by the elements that relate to the objective; they provide two important design elements: the context of the learning environment and the framework for evaluation for each learning event
* D represents *degree* or the standard of performance. An objective’s behavior element says “jump” and the degree element tells the learner “how high.”

TLOs are written from the perspective of what the student will do, not what the instructor will do. They:
* Target the performance required when students are evaluated, Not what they will do as part of the lesson.
* Are precise, observable, and measurable.
* Are stated in active terms.

Each objective affects on of the following four domains: 

* cognitive - thinking, problem solving, design
* affective - feelings, attitudes
* psychomotor - movement, manipulation of physical things
* interpersonal - relationships, teamwork

While less common at PCS than the other objectives, psychomotor learning objectives are present and address things like keyboarding skills and mouse usage.

## Enabling learning objectives

Each terminal learning objective is supported by one or more enabling learning objective, each of which states the instructor's expectations of student performance and the steps in accomplishing the TLO. The ELOs specify a detailed sequence of student activities. The ELOs usually generate the outline for the instructional phase of a lesson plan. Enabling objectives cover all of the cognitive, affective, and interpersonal skills students need to master to meet the TLO. Enabling learning objectives may require:

* Recall or recognition of facts
* Explanations or descriptions of procedures
* Paraphrasing of principles, theories, rules, concepts, or standards of conduct
* Demonstration of analysis, design, or construction skills

ELOs are written from the perspective of the student and what he/she must do to accomplish the TLO.

ELOs are concise. State the requirement in clear, direct language. Keep the objective as short as possible without sacrificing clarity.

ELOs are unambiguous: State the learning objective precisely and clearly. If an ELO is “open to interpretation” it has not met the requirement for a good learning objective.

Example:

````
TLO: All PCS students (A) will be able to preserve a history of their work in a local repository (B), given an existing local repository and a git install (C), in the form of a series of well-commented repository commits, without losing any revisions, so that a stranger can describe the work that was performed or the effect applying the commits will have on the codebase (D).

ELOs: Students will be able to:

1. Describe the benefits of preserving work history
2. List the commands that make up the revise-commit cycle workflow and describe what each command does
3. Explain the value of commit messages to themselves and other members of the team
4. Correctly execute the revise-commit cycle workflow for three revisions of one file
5. Display the commit history for the file
6. Display via diff command or GUI the revision changes from one commit to the next for the file
````


# Evaluation strategy

In the evaluation strategy part of the design plan, designers explain their thoughts behind the evaluation plan; they do not give examples of evaluation tasks.


# Facilitator Prerequisites

These prerequisites allow designers to prepare lesson plans and other materials knowing that facilitators meet a necessary skill level. Ranging also works for facilitators.


# Deliverables

In this section of the design plan, designers specify everything that will be delivered as part of the project. Deliverables are usually tangibles like:

* Analytical reports of target audience market and skills gap
* This design plan
* Draft materials, including syllabus, lesson plans, articles, example code, or screencasts authored by the instructors
* Evaluation & reporting mechanisms

# Copyright and license

These are the terms under which the instructor licenses the class to the school. The standard PCS process is for the instructor(s) to retain ownership and copyright to the class documentation and materials and for them to grant PCS a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use and modify the docs and materials in any way that it sees fit, as long as the instructor's original copyrights are preserved. See the instructor's contract agreement for correct verbiage.
